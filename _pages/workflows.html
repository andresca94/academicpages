  <h1>A Case Study with Barbara Feldon from Get Smart Using ComfyUI</h1>
  <p>In this creative project, we explore various capabilities of <strong>ComfyUI</strong> through the iconic actress <strong>Barbara Feldon</strong>, best known for her role as Agent 99 in the classic 1965–1970 TV series <em>Get Smart</em>. We utilize advanced tools such as FLUX, Hunyuan3D, and AnimateDiff to process, enhance, and animate Barbara’s visuals. This case study demonstrates a complete AI-assisted creative workflow from image restoration to video generation.</p>
