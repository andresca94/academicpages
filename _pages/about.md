About me:
======
Machine Learning Engineer at DeepMake
At DeepMake (seed-backed by Open Core Ventures and GitLab's CEO), I lead the development of AI-powered tools for visual artists and producers. Our work spans multiple platforms, offering AI plugins for Adobe After Effects, standalone upscalers, and cloud-based segmentation tools. Weâ€™ve achieved over 10,000 users, including professionals from Netflix, CNN, Apple, and BBC.

I focus on generative AI development using PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI, microservices, and Python. At DeepMake, I specialize in segmentation, upscaling, deepfakes, autoencoders, and diffusion models. I also fine-tune LoRAs and deploy models optimized for high-performance computing (CUDA) to create efficient solutions for creative media workflows.

Projects and Workflows:
======
1. ComfyUI Workflows
At DeepMake, I design and optimize workflows for ComfyUI, integrating various AI-driven solutions to enhance the creative capabilities of our users. The focus is on streamlining the creative process and making complex AI tools more accessible to professionals in the visual effects industry.

2. Generative AI Tools Development
My work includes the development of tools that leverage Stable Diffusion, SAM (Segment Anything Model), and Super Resolution algorithms. These tools help automate complex video production processes, enabling creative professionals to deliver high-quality content efficiently.
