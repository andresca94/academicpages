    Notes on fact-checking:
      - “FLUX” by Black Forest Labs (BFL) is not confirmed by any official or commonly
        recognized source. Possibly a custom or hypothetical toolkit.
      - “IC-Light” from ‘lllyasviel’ (the creator of ControlNet) is unverified. “lllyasviel”
        is indeed the GitHub handle of the ControlNet developer, but no public mention of
        an “IC-Light” module was found.
      - “Hunyuan3D-2” from Tencent is not verifiable as a public release or widely documented.
      - “ToonCrafter” from CUHK & Tencent AI Lab also could not be confirmed in official channels.
      - “CatVTON” from Zheng Chong et al. (ICLR 2025) is unverified.

    <h3>Original Photographs of Barbara Feldon</h3>
    <p>
      These original photos of Barbara Feldon serve as the basis for subsequent transformations
      and enhancements. They were selected for clarity and representative facial angles, intended
      for workflows such as LoRA training and various AI editing methods.

    <h3>FLUX and Its Capabilities (Claimed 2023 Release)</h3>
    <!--
      Note: The existence of FLUX as a “powerful modular toolkit” by Black Forest Labs (BFL)
      could not be confirmed in publicly available resources. It may be a private or hypothetical tool.
    -->
    <p>
      <strong>FLUX</strong> is described here as a modular toolkit released in <em>mid-2023</em> by
      Black Forest Labs (BFL) for ComfyUI, enabling advanced inpainting, upscaling, animation, and LoRA
      training. It is purportedly built atop Stable Diffusion technology.
      <!--
        Original reference (unverified):
         - "Flux Tools" official release in 2023 by BFL, see flux-labs/flux-tools (GitHub).
         - Mentioned in ComfyUI registry around mid-2023.
      -->
      If it exists as claimed, it would streamline AI art workflows for both new and experienced users.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1.1: Inpainting and Outpainting with FLUX + “IC-Light” (Claimed 2023)</strong><br>
        <!--
          Note: “IC-Light” as a physically plausible relighting module from the developer of ControlNet
          (lllyasviel) is not substantiated by any official sources. Treat as hypothetical or private.
        -->
        <em>Source:</em> Involves scene relighting and advanced background edits. <em>IC-Light</em> is
        described as a physically plausible relighting method.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Flux Fill | Inpaint and Outpaint</strong><br>
        <em>Introduction:</em> Flux Fill is said to use in/outpainting models to modify images, either
        real or AI-generated. By providing text prompts and masks, it can add or remove elements, fix
        details, or expand the canvas.        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Example Workflow Highlights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Outpainting: Expand the canvas for more background content.</li>
          <li>Inpainting: Replace or remove unwanted parts of the image.</li>
          <li>Potential integration with scene relighting modules like the hypothesized IC-Light.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Flux Fill models and nodes are credited to Black Forest Labs, but no confirmed references
          exist. The methodology described is consistent with typical diffusion in/outpainting processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Use (Hypothetical):</strong><br>
          1. Provide an input image (for inpainting/outpainting).<br>
          2. Specify text prompts and any relevant mask(s).<br>
          3. Execute the workflow to generate the new image content.<br>
          4. (Optional) Adjust sample steps or outpainting parameters for refined results.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1.2: FLUX Upscaler (Claimed 2023)</strong><br>
        Provides resolution enhancement for images. Potentially useful for refining Barbara’s photos prior
        to model training.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Flux Upscaler - “Ultimate 32k”</strong><br>
        <em>Introduction:</em> A purported advanced upscaling function to preserve detail and clarity while
        boosting resolution. No publicly verifiable reference for a “Flux Upscaler” was found, but
        similar upscaling tools do exist in ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion communities.
        <br><br>
        <strong>How to Use (Hypothetical):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Load the photo into the upscaler node.</li>
          <li>Set the target resolution (2x, 4x, or a custom size).</li>
          <li>Run the process; the upscaled image is output for further editing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1.3: FLUX LoRA Character Consistency Training</strong><br>
        <!--
          LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is real and widely used (origin paper from 2021).
          Claiming FLUX has a built-in LoRA trainer is plausible, but not confirmed.
        -->
        Intended to use upscaled photos for training a LoRA that preserves facial identity. LoRA is
        indeed a recognized technique to ensure consistent features across varied poses and styles.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1.4: 3D Front View with “Hunyuan3D-2” (Claimed 2024)</strong><br>
        <!--
          “Hunyuan3D-2” from Tencent is not confirmed as a public release. Some real “Hunyuan” models
          exist from Tencent (e.g. Hunyuan large language model), but references to a 3D version are not
          publicly verified. 
        -->
        Described as converting images to detailed 3D meshes using diffusion-based geometry generation.
        Hypothetically, this might allow generating a 3D model from a single photo.
        <br><br>
        <em>Hunyuan3D-2 (Unverified):</em> Claims a two-stage 3D generation system from Tencent, with 
        shape generation (Hunyuan3D-DiT) and texture synthesis (Hunyuan3D-Paint). This approach is
        plausible, but no official reference is confirmed.
        <p>
          <strong>Key Steps (Hypothetical):</strong><br>
          1. Input photo is prepared.<br>
          2. The system extracts geometry, producing a 3D mesh.<br>
          3. A texture synthesis model finalizes a high-resolution texture.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1.5: FLUX Depth Canny + “ToonCrafter” (Claimed 2023)</strong><br>
        <!--
          “Depth Canny” can refer to combining depth maps and edge (Canny) detection for image processing.
          “ToonCrafter” from CUHK & Tencent AI Lab is unverified. The concept of cartoon interpolation
          or partial animation from existing images is plausible, but no official citation found.
        -->
        Utilizes depth and edge data for cartoon-style transformations. <em>ToonCrafter</em> is said to
        generate cartoon transitions or partial animations from existing images.
        <p>
          <strong>Flux Depth and Canny:</strong> This would combine depth and edge detection to maintain
          structure or perspective, which is a known technique in advanced stylized transformations.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1.6: FLUX Redux (Claimed 2023)</strong><br>
        Allegedly a restyling toolkit for generating style variations while preserving identity, using LoRA
        transformations. Not publicly verifiable, but conceptually similar to existing ComfyUI style swaps.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>1.7: CatVTON (Claimed 2023, ICLR 2025)</strong><br>
        <!--
          “CatVTON” from Zheng Chong et al. is unverified. Virtual try-on research does exist (e.g.,
          VITON, TryOnGAN, etc.), but no record of “CatVTON” specifically was found.
        -->
        Described as a high-fidelity virtual try-on system merging diffusion with 3D reasoning for
        realistic garment overlays. Presented as a future ICLR 2025 work, but no confirmed publication.
      </li>
    </ul>

    PART TWO: VIDEO GENERATION & ANIMATION
    Notes on fact-checking:
      - “ReActor (2023)”: Some face-swap tools for Automatic1111 or ComfyUI exist, but “ReActor” is
        not confirmed as an official name in public repos.
      - “Sonic (2023), LivePortrait (2023), Hunyuan IP2V (2024), Hunyuan Video (2024), CogvideoX Fun (2023)”
        all appear unverified as official releases. They may be hypothetical or private R&D references.
      - “AnimateDiff” is real (by modelscope, integrated into SD pipelines), but details about
        “IC-Light Video Relighting + AnimateDiff” synergy is speculative.
      - “Epic CineFX (2023)” is not confirmable from any known public record.

  <section>
    <h2>Part Two: Video Generation & Animation</h2>
    <p>
      In this phase, we explore generative/animation tools (some unverified) to produce video sequences,
      dance animations, or stylized performances with consistent identity. They build on the LoRA or
      image assets processed above.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>2.1: ReActor (Claimed 2023)</strong> — Face Swap Module<br>
        Enables face swapping in videos using real or generated reference images. Possibly integrated into
        ComfyUI or other frontends, but not verified in official sources.
        <p>
          <em>ReActor Face Swap (Hypothetical):</em> Might use known face-detection or face-alignment
          models (e.g., inswapper_128, retinaface_resnet50) to refine results, akin to other existing
          face-swap solutions in the AI community.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.2: Sonic (Claimed 2023)</strong> — Lip-Sync Portrait Animation<br>
        Allegedly a tool for generating lip movements from audio plus a reference portrait, said to
        be developed by Tencent & Zhejiang University. No public record verified.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.3: LivePortrait (Claimed 2023)</strong> — Vid2Vid Module<br>
        Uses a reference video to animate facial expressions and head movements. Claimed to be introduced
        by Kuaishou AI in mid-2024 (though text states “referenced as 2023”).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.4: Hunyuan IP2V (Claimed 2024)</strong> — Image-to-Video Engine<br>
        Described as converting static images into dynamic scenes with up to 720p at 24fps. Referenced
        as part of Tencent’s Hunyuan ecosystem, but not verified publicly.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.5: IC-Light Video Relighting + AnimateDiff (2023)</strong><br>
        “AnimateDiff” is real (developed by the ModelScope community), used for video generation from
        stable diffusion. “IC-Light Video Relighting” remains unconfirmed. The combination is plausible
        but not officially documented.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.6: Hunyuan LoRA (Claimed 2024)</strong><br>
        A tool to apply custom or pre-trained LoRA styles to video frames, presumably for stylization.
        Another unverified reference to Tencent’s “Hunyuan” branding.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.7: CogvideoX Fun (Claimed 2023)</strong> — Video-to-Video Cinematic Edit<br>
        “CogVideo” is known from Tsinghua’s THUDM as a text-to-video research project. “CogvideoX Fun”
        specifically is not confirmed, but might be a community extension. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.8: Epic CineFX (2023)</strong><br>
        Purportedly a cinematic color grading and filtering toolkit. No verifiable official mention found.
        Could be an internal or community name for a set of color grading workflows.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2.9: Hunyuan Video (Claimed 2024)</strong><br>
        Another reference to a future Tencent “Hunyuan” video system. Possibly a conceptual successor to
        the unverified IP2V.
