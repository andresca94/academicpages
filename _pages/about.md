About me:
======
I am an engineer and developer, currently working as a **_Machine Learning Engineer_** in the **_VFX, fashion and media industry_**. I lead the development of **_AI-powered tools_** for visual artists and producers.  
My work spans multiple platforms, offering **_AI plugins for Adobe After Effects_**, standalone **_upscalers_**, cloud-based **_segmentation tools_**, and **_ComfyUI workflows_**. I also build personalized environments for local and cloud deployment, with seamless integration into professional video editing software.

I focus on **_generative AI development_** using **_PyTorch_**, **_TensorFlow_**, **_FastAPI_**, **_microservices_**, and **_Python_**.  
I specialize in **_segmentation_**, **_upscaling_**, **_deepfakes_**, **_autoencoders_**, and **_diffusion models_**. I also fine-tune **_LoRAs_** and deploy models optimized for **_high-performance computing (CUDA)_** to create efficient solutions for creative media workflows.

To see my other work related to LLMs, AI Agents, RAG-based apps, and Data Science, check out my [portfolio website](https://andresca94.github.io/).

Projects and Workflows:
======
1. **_Generative AI Tools Development_**:  
My work includes the development of tools that leverage **_Stable Diffusion_**, **_SAM (Segment Anything Model)_**, and **_Super Resolution_** algorithms. These tools help automate complex video production processes, enabling creative professionals to deliver high-quality content efficiently.

2. **_ComfyUI Workflows_**:  
I design and optimize workflows for **_ComfyUI_**, integrating various AI-driven solutions to enhance the creative capabilities of our users. The focus is on streamlining the creative process and making complex AI tools more accessible to professionals in the **_visual effects industry_**.
